# Payday 2 DLC Unlocker
A twist on the normal Payday 2 DLC Unlocker.

## Why I made this?
I know that there are so many DLC Unlockers out there for Payday 2 but as far as I could tell none of them allowed to user to enable and disable the DLCs as they wished.

## Random Info
I'm planning on adding the built in 'Mod Options' menu to this but this is my first mod for Payday 2. This runs on SuperBLT and the original method for enabling the DLC's is long gone in my mind.

## Usage
- Download Payday 2 Super BLT at https://superblt.znix.xyz/
- Put the DLCUnlocker folder in the ``PAYDAY 2/mods`` folder
- Edit the ``PAYDAY 2/mods/DLCUnlocker/UnlockDLCs.lua`` as you wish, just set the DLC you want to ``true`` instead of ``false``
